        <!-- a short paragraph about why I think Christmas is the best holiday-->
            <p>Christmas is the main and most exciting holiday of the year. Everyone looks forward to the cold weather, fires, hot chocolate, and sledding, and Christmas is the highlight of the season. Not only do you get to look forward to presents, but you get to spend time with your family and friends enjoying the Christmas spirit and decorations.</p>
            <br />
            <p>With all of these festivities comes the best part, the music. Throughout the season you hear the best songs that everybody loves, and you can't help but find yourself singing along. </p>
            <br />
